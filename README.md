Please work on this project in your personal github account.

Before you begin

2. Send an estimate of the time you will be working on this project, both your expected start date and how long you think it will take.
3. At your convenience please start the project and come to me with any questions.

Using Angular or Javascript, write an article extractor which when given a url string as input will scrape the complete text of the article and return it as a text file. (Do not just implement a pre-built library as that would be trivial.)

Example: 
Input
You method can take as input the following url string: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/21/swat-lobby-takes-a-shot-at-congress.html

Output
the main boby of the article written to a text file 

*News articles are structured differently so your extractor may not work for all of them but should work most of the time, and at least work for the one provided in the example.
